<h3>Weapons</h3>

<h4>SP Weapons</h4><p>
For HR5 and G-rank quests, weapon multiplier +10 and +20% affinity.</p>

<h4>HC Weapons</h4><p>
For hardcore quests, melee weapons will have their sharpness gauge increased by 1 level. Bowguns/bows will have a +40% affinity boost.</p>

<h4>Master Mark</h4><p>
The weapon can be Unsheathed and Sheathed 20% faster. Skill: Equivalent to Weapon Handling</p>

<h4>Evolution Weapons</h4><p>
<strong>Evolution Weapons（Melee）</strong><br>
Power Sword Crystals can be set. While equipped, the weapon multiplier is 1.2x, and the consumption of the sharpness gauge is 4x.</p>
<p>
<strong>Evolution Weapons（Bow）</strong><br>
Can be equipped with an impact coating. The attack becomes a stun attribute and the damage calculation is calculated based on the hit quality. Melee accumulates 2 stun and 4 for arrows.</p>
<p>
<strong>Evolution Weapons（Light Bowgun）</strong><br>
Acid S and Dragon Acid S can be loaded. Each bullet has a +10 part quality effect on the part where it hits, which lasts for 30 seconds. Boss monsters only</p>

<h4>Gou Weapons</h4><p>
<strong>Gou Weapons（Melee）</strong><br>
If your HP and stamina are at maximum, your attacks will not bounce.</p>
<p>
<strong>Gou Weapons（Bow）</strong><br>
Can equip explosive coatings. While using the explosive coatings, the original attribute will be overwritten and will not be activated. <br>
All explosove coating damage is fixed damage, and only the overall defense rate is affected. <br>
Weapons are quicker to deploy and retract. <br>
The effect of the power coating is changed to 1.6 times.</p>
<p>
<strong>Gou Weapons（Light Bowgun）</strong><br>
・rapid-fire<br>
If the user presses the "fire" key during rapid-fire, the next rapid-fire will be started in succession. (Each press of the fire key consumes ammunition.)<br>
In that case, the number of rounds fired in rapid fire increases by one round for each additional input. (In the case of normal bullets, 5 rounds -> 6 rounds -> 7 rounds -> ...)<br>
The recoil after firing changes with the number of times the weapon is fired rapidly, and naturally, the more times the weapon is fired, the more the recoil. (The recoil can be reduced to some extent with recoil reduction).<br>
　For example, with recoil reduction +2, up to 4 shots will have small recoil, 5 or 6 shots will have medium recoil, and the 7th and subsequent shots will have large recoil.<br>
　　　　　　With recoil reduction +1, up to four shots will have medium recoil, and the fifth and later shots will have Large recoil.</p>
<p>
<strong>Gou Weapons（Heavy Bowgun）</strong><br>
・Heat Beam<br>
It can be used by attaching the "Heat Beam" to a Gou type heavy bowgun.<br>
Each time a bullet is fired, an "internal temperature gauge" accumulates, and when it reaches its maximum, a "heat beam" can be fired.<br>
　：Internal Temperature Gauge<br>
　・Base 100/minimum 40/maximum 200. Increases by 10 each time you hit with a heat bomb. Or +10 with Warm Oil, -10 with Cooling Oil.<br>
　・The gauge fills up every time you shoot a bullet. After firing the bullet, reduction starts in 3 seconds, and the gauge decreases by 1 per second.<br>
　・After charging is complete, the gauge will flash. Reduction starts 5 seconds after charging is complete.<br>
　・If you reload the heat bomb, it will stop reducing. <small> (Reloading itself is possible even if not accumulated)</small><br>
　・1 Hit Fixed 22 + 10 fire damage. 6 Hits per 10 gauge (damage is affected by overall defense ratio).<br>
<small>　　　(Gunnery: 24 + fire 10, Artillery Expert: 26 + fire 10, Artillery God: 28 + fire 10 / HBG Tech [Gun Sage] is multiplied by 1.2 for both fixed and fire)</small><br>
<small>　　　(For initial gauge: 100 ÷ 10 × 6 × 22 = 1320 + fire 600)</small><br>
<small>　　　※2 Hit limit for small monsters?</small></p>

</table>
<p><small>In areas with boss monsters, +1 is added to the accumulation value except for LV1 normal bullets. <br>Also, in the case of the storm style, it will be added according to the charge stage.</small></p>
<h4>Tenran / Supremacy (G-rank Supremacy) Weapon</h4><p>
If you equip 2 or more pieces of Tenran armor and go to a quest for a gou rank/supremacy rank (G-rank),<br>
Melee weapons will have their sharpness gauge increased by 1 level. Bow guns/bows will have their multiplier at critical distance increased by +0.3.<br>
In addition, for bows, the effect of the power coating changes to 1.7</p>
